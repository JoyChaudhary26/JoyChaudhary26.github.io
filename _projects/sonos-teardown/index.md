title: Low velocity Impact testing machine
description:Designed and built a drop-weight impact testing system to address the lack of in-house capabilities for impact testing at the university. The setup features a calibrated mass-drop mechanism, precision linear guides, adjustable impact energy control, specimen holder, automatic hoisting and load cell. The machine was fully designed, manufactured, and assembled in-house, and is now operational for testing composites used in Formula Student race cars and other research applications.
