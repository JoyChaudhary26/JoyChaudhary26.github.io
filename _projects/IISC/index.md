title: DED laser, powder based metal AM platform
description: During my Research Internship at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), I developed a Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing platform, carrying out the design, workspace analysis, modal analysis, MATLAB-based modelling, and full-scale prototype manufacturing. I personally executed CNC milling and turning operations using in-house facilities, programmed toolpaths, and integrated a precision powder feeder. The project was completed in two months, demonstrating my ability to manage complex mechanical builds efficiently from concept to operational prototype.
